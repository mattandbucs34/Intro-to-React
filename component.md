1. The checkpoint doesn't say that I need to submit my findings, but I am going to anyway. In the reading and in discussions with my mentor, I found that React is quite simple to implement. Utilizing Classes and components seems like a simplistic way to create different objects and aspects of an application. The way I have tried to understand the `props` and `state` objects is pretty "dumbed down." The `props` object is basically a call from another component and the `state` object is the state or status of "this" component. I found it interesting that components are essentially Classes and user defined elements.
