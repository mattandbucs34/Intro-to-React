1. Some of the main differences between `props` and `state` are that `props` are attributes that can be added to our created components whereas `state` are attributes that are within a component. `props` are immutable, or cannot be changed. `state` are defined within a component and can be mutated with a function or functions. However, the `state` will always return to it's original state upon refresh or reload of a component.
